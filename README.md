# CHESS GAME
This repository contains a simple java implementation of a chess game made during the bachelor degree.
It includes several modalities:
  - Player vs Player 
  - Player vs Computer
  - Computer vs Computer

This game must be played in the terminal, since it hasn't a graphic engine.

Unfortunately, this code was made with the italian language.
